# Financial-Analytics

I've completed an insightful competition analysis of the Top 500 Companies in India, focusing on market capitalization and quarterly sales. The project involved:

Analyzing data to uncover key metrics and competitive insights.
Visualizing relationships between market cap and sales.
Highlighting top-performing companies with actionable recommendations for business strategies.
A big thanks to the #UnifiedMentorInternship for this incredible learning experience and for providing the opportunity to develop my data science skills in real-world scenarios.
